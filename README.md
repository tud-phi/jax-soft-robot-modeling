This repository contains symbolic derivations of the kinematics and dynamics of various soft robots using Sympy.
The symbolic expressions are then implemented in JAX and can be used for fast, parallelizable, and differentiable simulations.
So far, we have focused on planar settings and implemented the following soft robots:

- [N-link pendulum](examples/simulate_pendulum.py)
- [Planar Piecewise Constant Strain (PCS) continuum soft robot](examples/simulate_planar_pcs.py)
- [Planar Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA) robot](examples/simulate_planar_hsa.py)

We are happy to receive contributions for other soft robots and/or other settings (e.g., 3D).

## Citation

This simulator is part of the publication **An Experimental Study of Model-based Control
for Planar Handed Shearing Auxetics Robots** presented at the _18th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics_. 
You can find the publication online in the Springer Proceedings on Advanced Robotics (SPAR): https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63596-0_14

Please use the following citation if you use our software in your (scientific) work:

```bibtex
@inproceedings{stolzle2023experimental,
  title={An experimental study of model-based control for planar handed shearing auxetics robots},
  author={St{\"o}lzle, Maximilian and Rus, Daniela and Della Santina, Cosimo},
  booktitle={International Symposium on Experimental Robotics},
  pages={153--167},
  year={2023},
  organization={Springer}
}
```

## Installation

The plugin can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install jsrm
```

or locally from the source code:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you want to run the examples, you will also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[examples]"
```

## Usage

Always first source all necessary environment variables when opening a new terminal:

```bash
source 01-configure-env-vars.sh
```

Then, we can symbolically derive the pendulum kinematics and dynamics:

```bash
python examples/derive_pendulum.py
```

Finally, we can simulate the pendulum
```bash
python examples/simulate_pendulum.py
```

## Documentation

The full documentation is available at: https://tud-phi.github.io/jax-soft-robot-modelling

### Building Documentation Locally

To build and serve the documentation locally:

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"

# Serve documentation with live reload (if mkdocs is in PATH)
mkdocs serve

# OR using conda environment
conda run --live-stream --name jsrm mkdocs serve
```

The documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Building Documentation for Production

```bash
# Build static documentation (if mkdocs is in PATH)
mkdocs build

# OR using conda environment
conda run --live-stream --name jsrm mkdocs build

# Build with strict mode (for CI/development)
mkdocs build --strict
# OR: conda run --live-stream --name jsrm mkdocs build --strict

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (maintainers only)
mkdocs gh-deploy
# OR: conda run --live-stream --name jsrm mkdocs gh-deploy
```

You can also use the Makefile targets:

```bash
# Serve locally
make docs-serve

# Build documentation
make docs-build

# Build with strict mode checking
make docs-build-strict

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
make docs-deploy
```

 of the Selective Piecewise Constant Strain (SPCS) kinematics in JAX. We have shown in our paper that this kinematic 
model is suitable for representing the shape of HSA rods.
