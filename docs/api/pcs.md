# PCS Systems (General)

The general Piecewise Constant Strain (PCS) implementation provides the core modeling framework for continuum soft robots.

## Overview

This module contains the fundamental PCS implementation that serves as the foundation for more specialized PCS variants. It provides the core mathematical framework for modeling continuum robots using piecewise constant strain assumptions.
