# Pendulum Systems

The pendulum module provides implementations for N-link pendulum systems, which are useful for benchmarking and comparison with soft robot systems.

## Overview

The pendulum system implements classical rigid-body dynamics for articulated robots with revolute joints. This serves as a baseline for comparing with continuum soft robot models.
