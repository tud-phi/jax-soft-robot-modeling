# Planar HSA Systems

The Planar Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA) systems provide implementations for soft robots with auxetic properties in planar settings.

## Overview

HSA robots exhibit unique mechanical properties due to their auxetic structure, which allows for interesting deformation patterns and control strategies. This module implements the kinematic and dynamic models for planar HSA robots.
