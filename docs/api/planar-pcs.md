# Planar PCS Systems

The planar Piecewise Constant Strain (PCS) systems provide implementations for 2D soft continuum robots using the Cosserat rod theory with piecewise constant strain assumptions, based on the discrete Cosserat approach by Renda et al. (2018).

## Overview

The PCS model divides the continuum robot into segments, each with constant strain properties. This approach, originally proposed by Renda et al. (2018), provides a good balance between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy for soft continuum robots.
