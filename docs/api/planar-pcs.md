# Planar PCS Systems

The Planar Piecewise Constant Strain (PCS) systems provide implementations for 2D soft continuum robots using the Cosserat rod theory with piecewise constant strain assumptions.

## Overview

The PCS model divides the continuum robot into segments, each with constant strain properties. This approach provides a good balance between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy for soft continuum robots.
