# Pneumatically Actuated Planar PCS

Pneumatically actuated Planar PCS systems with pressure-based actuation mechanisms.

## Overview

This module extends the planar PCS model to include pneumatic actuation, where the robot is actuated by controlling internal pressure in chambers or bellows. This actuation method is common in soft pneumatic robots.
