# Pneumatically Actuated Planar PCS

Pneumatically actuated Planar PCS systems with pressure-based actuation mechanisms, extending the discrete Cosserat approach by Renda et al. (2018).

## Overview

This module extends the planar PCS model (based on the discrete Cosserat approach by Renda et al., 2018) to include pneumatic actuation, where the robot is actuated by controlling internal pressure in chambers or bellows. This actuation method is common in soft pneumatic robots.
