# Tendon Actuated Planar PCS

Tendon actuated Planar PCS systems with cable-driven actuation mechanisms.

## Overview

This module extends the planar PCS model to include tendon actuation, where the robot is actuated by controlling the tension in cables or tendons. This actuation method provides precise control and is commonly used in cable-driven continuum robots.
