We welcome contributions from the community! If you're interested in contributing to this project, please check out our [Contributing Guide](development/contributing.md).

## Acknowledgments

This work is supported by the Physical Intelligence (PhI) Lab at TU Delft and benefits from collaborations with researchers worldwide working on soft robotics and continuum mechanics.

### Theoretical Foundations

We gratefully acknowledge the foundational contributions of Prof. Federico Renda, Prof. Frederic Boyer, and Dr. Anup Teejo Mathew, along with all other researchers who developed the soft robot strain models (including PCS - Piecewise Constant Strain, GVS - Geometric Variable-Strain, and other approaches) that are implemented in this library. Their pioneering work in continuum mechanics for soft robotics and the development of modeling frameworks has made this JAX implementation possible.

### Inspiration

This package was inspired by **SoRoSim**, a MATLAB toolbox for hybrid rigid-soft robots. We acknowledge the pioneering work of the SoRoSim team in making soft robot modeling accessible to the research community.
